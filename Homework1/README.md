Project Title: 
	Marketing Agency Code Refactor

Description:
	In this project the Horiseon Marketing Agencies Website was refactored using HTML and CSS to make the website more accessible. Some challenges I faced was having to reorganize the order of the CSS code, I also removed the id tags and combined elements into similar classes to avoid retyping the same lines of code. I had trouble getting the background image to display then realized it was in the CSS file. I initially struggled getting the images to open then when verifying the path realized I hadn't added my /images folder. I think an important feature to implement in the future would be bootstrap to make the website more interactive and more user friendly. This is an important reason to make their website more accessible. If it's easier and more user friendly then more people will probably want to use their services. My motivation to build this project was to help the client achieve their business goals by having an accessible website that is easy to navigate.
