Project Title: Password Generator

Description: In this project I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selection criteria to make choosing a password easier for clients. Some challenges I faced was organizing the DOM elements and getting all of the CSS code to function as I wanted. I had trouble getting the random numbers to generate at first then realized could create seperate functions for this. I think an important feature to implement in the future would be to work with the CSS from scratch then build in the provided code, just more practice basically to make the page more user friendly and styled. This is an important reason to make the page look nicer. If it's easier and more user friendly then more people will probably want to use theis generator service. My motivation to build this project was to help the client achieve their business goals by having an accessible password generator website that is easy to navigate.
